        <ul class="list">
            <li><b>Entry into service :</b>
                The SKOT entered service with the Indian Army in the 1970s, imported from Eastern Europe. It complemented
                <p>the existing fleet of tracked APCs, offering an alternative with higher speed and mobility for road-based operations.
                </p>
            <br>
            <li><b>Mjaor Operation :</b>
                While it was not specifically involved in any major Indo-Pak conflicts, the SKOT played a supportive role in border patrols
                  <p><b>border patrols, counter-insurgency operations, and internal security duties</b>due to its mobility and troop-carrying capacity. </p>                                
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Retirement:</b>
                The SKOT began to be phased out in the late 1990s and early 2000s as the Indian Army upgraded to more advanced
            <p>APCs and infantry fighting vehicles like the BMP-2, which provided greater firepower and armor protection.</p>

        <h1>Historical Significance</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The SKOT APC enhanced the Indian Army's ability to conduct rapid troop movement and border</p>
        <p>patrols. Its wheeled design allowed it to cover longer distances quickly compared to tracked</p>
        <p>APCs, making it an effective vehicle for patrolling large border areas and providing internal </p>
        <p>security. Its amphibious capability added flexibility, though it was primarily used on land.</p>
