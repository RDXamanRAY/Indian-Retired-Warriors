        <h1>Historical Significance</h1>
        <br>
        The Mystère IV marked India’s first entry into supersonic-era jet technology and provided the IAF with much-needed ground-attack capability. Its success in the 1965 and 1971 wars,
         particularly in low-level attack missions, demonstrated the Mystère’s adaptability and durability. The aircraft contributed to India’s tactical air strength and laid the groundwork 
         for integrating advanced jet technology into the IAF.

    <div class="mission">
        <h1>Notable Missions</h1>
        <br>
       <ul class="list">
        <li><b>1965 Indo-Pak War:</b> The Mystère IV played a major role, striking Pakistani airfields, armored positions, and supply depots. It supported Indian ground forces with precision 
            and agility, helping to neutralize enemy assets effectively.  
        </li>
       

        <br>

        <li><b>1971 Indo-Pak War:</b>The Mystère IV was again deployed extensively in ground-attack missions, proving invaluable in attacking enemy fortifications and logistic lines. It
             contributed to the IAF’s ability to dominate the airspace over strategic regions.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li><b>Cross-Border Operations:</b>The Mystère IV’s reliability and maneuverability allowed it to conduct cross-border strikes, contributing to intelligence gathering and pre-emptive
             strikes during times of heightened tensions with neighboring forces.
