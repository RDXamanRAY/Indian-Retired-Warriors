            <li><b>Entry into service :</b>
                The HAL Cheetah entered service in 1976, tailored for high-altitude operations where other helicopters struggled due to thin air and challenging conditions.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Major Operations :</b> 
                The Cheetah has been crucial in India’s military operations and logistical support missions, including during the <b>Kargil War</b> 
             <p>of 1999. It has also been deployed for various high-altitude patrols, casualty evacuation, and supply runs in Siachen, the highest battlefield in the world.</p>

        <h1>Historical Significance</h1>
        <br>
        The HAL Cheetah’s contribution to India’s defense has been significant, especially in high-altitude operations where 
        helicopters are indispensable for logistical support, reconnaissance, and evacuation. Its capability to perform reliably 
        in extreme conditions has been essential to maintaining Indian outposts and operations in remote, high-altitude areas.
         The Cheetah has symbolized India’s resilience in maintaining operations on the challenging Himalayan frontiers.

    <div class="mission">
        <h1>Notable Missions</h1>
        <br>
       <ul class="list">
        <li><b>Siachen Glacier Operations:  </b>The Cheetah has been the backbone of logistics and supply missions
             in Siachen, enabling the Indian Army to maintain posts at altitudes exceeding 20,000 feet. It has ferried supplies, ammunition, and personnel to remote outposts where no other airlift capability is feasible.

        </li>

        <br>

        <li><b>Kargil War (1999): </b>The Cheetah played a vital role in high-altitude reconnaissance and casualty evacuation, supporting Indian forces during the Kargil conflict in challenging terrain.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li><b>Disaster Relief Missions: </b>The Cheetah has also participated in various rescue and relief missions, particularly in mountainous regions and areas affected by landslides or natural disasters, where its light footprint and high-altitude capability allow it to reach isolated locations.
